** Rationale
Previously, I used multi-file emacs config: =init.el= loads lots of
files with corresponding configuration code. For example,
=setup-clojure.el= contains the code which is related to Clojure
setup -- just code, without using any kind of tools like =use-package=

But at some point of time I decided to get back to one big init.el:
sometimes i quickly add\edit some configuration on-fly and then don't
reboot emacs. Or, more rarely, something breaks after update of
packages\emacs itself and I restart emacs daemon. Since =load-file=
is runtime fn for loading emacs lisp code, I don't get clear location
if =init.el= loading fails: from interpreter perspective it's all in =init.el=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Warning (initialization): An error occurred while loading ‘/home/zarkone/.emacs.d/init.el’:

Symbol's value as variable is void: aslkj11!
#+END_EXAMPLE

Another problem is that it's hard to remember why some config code was
added long time ago. I hope that literate programming approach will
force me to comment all the changes.

And another reason why I decided to port my config to org is that I think
it's a good chance to remove old garbage and adopt new, better
solutions and approaches.

See [[file:literally.org]] for actual configuration description

emacs config, used as a skeleton.
